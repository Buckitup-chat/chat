# The block below contains prod specific runtime configuration.

  # ## Using releases
  #
  # If you are doing OTP releases, you need to instruct Phoenix
  # to start each relevant endpoint:
  #
  #     config :chat, ChatWeb.Endpoint, server: true
  #
  # Then you can assemble a release by calling `mix release`.
  # See `mix help release` for more information.

  # ## Configuring the mailer
  #
  # In production you need to configure the mailer to use a different adapter.
  # Also, you may need to configure the Swoosh API client of your choice if you
  # are not using SMTP. Here is an example of the configuration:
  #
  #     config :chat, Chat.Mailer,
  #       adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Mailgun,
  #       api_key: System.get_env("MAILGUN_API_KEY"),
  #       domain: System.get_env("MAILGUN_DOMAIN")
  #
  # For this example you need include a HTTP client required by Swoosh API client.
  # Swoosh supports Hackney and Finch out of the box:
  #
  #     config :swoosh, :api_client, Swoosh.ApiClient.Hackney
  #
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh/Swoosh.html#module-installation for details.
